Anarchy: the good kind
----------------------
All of the well-established projects have their own mailing list, source code
repository (git or mercurial), bug tracker, and **culture**.

- `SciPy <http://scipy.org/>`__ - Home of NumPy and SciPy (array library,
  scientifically-oriented data analysis

- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ - plotting library

- `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`__ - improved interactive shell, web notebook

- `MayaVi <http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/#Mayavi>`__

- `sckits <http://scikits.appspot.com/>`__:

  - `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org>`__ - image processing
  - `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`__ - machine learning

- `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ - data analysis

- `statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`__ - just what you'd
  think.

- `sympy <http://sympy.org>`__ - symbolic mathematics

  - `Release 0.7.2
    <http://sympy.blogspot.com/2012/10/sympy-072-is-released.html>`__

- `cython <http://cython.org>`__ - C speed without semicolons! (or pointers)

- `pytables <http://pytables.github.com/>`__ - efficiently and easily cope
  with extremely large amounts of data (HDF5).

IDEs:
-----

- `Spyder <http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`__ - integrated development
  environment for the Python (IDE)

- `Ninja-IDE <http://ninja-ide.org/>`__ - "Ninja-IDE Is Not Just Another IDE"

Bundles and whole distributions
-------------------------------

The following can be your "one-stop shopping" destinations for getting
up-and-running with a whole ecosystems of tools.

- `Python (x,y) <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`__ - Windows,
  experimental Linux support.

- `Scipy Superpack <http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/>`__ - Mac OS
  X (recent version only).

- `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org/>`__ - not only does it ship with the
  tools we discussed, but also many others, both numerical and symbolic. "The
  Borg" which assimilates  `nearly 100 open-source packages`_ and features a
  unified interface. (cross-platform)

.. _nearly 100 open-source packages: http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html

- `Enthought Canopy <http://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`__
  has the basics you off the ground. (cross-platform)

- `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda>`__ Community Edition
  is free for everyone. Pro version free for academics (edu address).
